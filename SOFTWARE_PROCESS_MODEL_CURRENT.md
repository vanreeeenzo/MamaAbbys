# Software Process Model Documentation - MamaAbbys Android Application
## Current Implementation Status

## Introduction
MamaAbbys is an Android-based business management application that has been developed to streamline and enhance the operations of small to medium-sized businesses. The application currently implements a comprehensive system for managing sales, inventory, deliveries, and user notifications, with a focus on real-time tracking and efficient data management.

## Current System Architecture
The application is built using Java as the primary programming language, with a robust SQLite database backend (MyDataBaseHelper.java) that handles all data persistence requirements. The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between different components:

1. **User Management System**
   - Implemented through Login.java and Register.java
   - Secure user authentication and registration processes
   - User role management and access control

2. **Dashboard System**
   - Centralized dashboard (DashboardTabFragment.java)
   - Custom view pager implementation (DashboardPagerAdapter.java)
   - Interactive dashboard items with click handling (DashboardItemClickListener.java)
   - Real-time data updates through DashboardDataProvider.java

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Comprehensive inventory tracking (InventoryFragment.java)
   - Advanced search functionality (InventorySearchManager.java)
   - Inventory item management (InventoryItem.java)
   - Add/Edit inventory operations (AddInventory.java)

4. **Sales Management**
   - Sales tracking and recording (SalesFragment.java)
   - Sales summary generation (SalesSummary.java)
   - Sales record management (SalesRecord.java)
   - Event-driven sales updates (SalesEventBus.java)

5. **Delivery System**
   - Delivery tracking and management (DeliveryFragment.java)
   - Delivery status monitoring (DeliveryChecker.java)
   - Detailed delivery information (DeliveryDetailsActivity.java)
   - Order management (Order.java, OrderAdapter.java)

6. **Notification System**
   - Real-time notifications (NotificationActivity.java)
   - Notification management (NotificationHelper.java)
   - Custom notification items (NotificationItem.java)

## Current Features and Functionality
